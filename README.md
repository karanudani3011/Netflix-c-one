A *Netflix Clone* is a video streaming platform inspired by Netflix, offering users the ability to browse, watch, and manage their favorite movies and TV shows. It features a responsive design with a modern user interface, categories for genres, a search bar, user authentication, and a personalized watchlist. Using technologies like React, Node.js, and a database for storing user data and content details, the clone aims to replicate Netflix's core functionality while providing a customizable framework for entertainment streaming.
